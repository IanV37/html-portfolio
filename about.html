<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I graduated from the University of Texas-San Antonio in 
    2019, and was soon after hired by USAA. At the same time 
    I serve in the U.S. Army Reserve as a Mass Communication Sergeant.
</p>
<p>My journey in software Development began when i received an offer
    from USAA to attend a program called eFit, or employees for IT. 
    This program, along with VetFit, or veterans for IT sought to train
    people without a software engineering background and then hire them 
    within USAA as a software Developer. 
</p>
<p>Currently I work as a Software Engineer for USAA. I am married with 
    2 dogs and live in San Antonio, TX.
